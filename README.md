## Planned Architecture
*(Placeholder â€“ to be updated with diagram once development begins)*

**Flow (MVP Concept):**
1. User submits sample messages or emails to establish a tone profile.
2. Profile is stored securely in S3.
3. When generating a reply:
   - API Gateway triggers Lambda function.
   - Lambda sends prompt + tone profile to Amazon Bedrock.
4. Bedrock returns a reply in the userâ€™s style.
5. Reply is stored in S3 and displayed to the user.
